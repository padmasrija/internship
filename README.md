# Project Name: Bank Customer Churn Prediction
## Learning Objectives:
Data Encoding: Utilized techniques to encode categorical variables for model compatibility.
Feature Scaling: Implemented scaling methods to normalize numerical features.
Handling Imbalanced Data:
Random Under Sampling: Balanced dataset by reducing majority class instances.
Random Over Sampling: Augmented minority class instances to balance dataset.
Support Vector Machine Classifier: Built and evaluated SVM classifier for churn prediction.
Grid Search For Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized SVM model performance using grid search.

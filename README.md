# Project Name: Bank Customer Churn Prediction
# Overview:
This project was completed as part of the YBI Foundation Data Science with Python internship, focusing on predicting customer churn in a bank using various machine learning techniques.

# Learning Objectives:
Data Encoding: Employed techniques like one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.

Feature Scaling: Implemented scaling methods such as Min-Max scaling and standardization to normalize numerical features, ensuring optimal model performance.

Handling Imbalanced Data:

Random Under Sampling: Addressed class imbalance by randomly reducing the number of instances in the majority class.
Random Over Sampling: Balanced the dataset by duplicating instances from the minority class using random sampling techniques.
